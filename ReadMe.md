The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that, when followed, help create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming.


‚úÖ Goals
========
We'd like to make our code
1. readability
2. maintainbility
3. testability
4. extensibility

===================
üíé SOLID Principles
===================
- Single Responsibilty Principle
- Open/Closed
- Liskov's Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion
Inversion of Dependency / Inversion of Control / Interface Segregation
Dependency Inversion / Dependency Injection



üí≠ Context
==========
- Simple Zoo Game ü¶ä
- Some characters - zoo staff, visitors, animals, ...
- Some structures - cages, walls, doors, ...




üé® Design Characters
====================
```java
class ZooEntity {
// classes are blueprints for concepts

// attributes [properties]
// visitor attributes
String visitorName;
Integer age;
String gender;
String address;
// zoo staff attributes
String staffName;
Integer employeeID;
Integer monthlySalary;
String address;
String gender;
// animal attributes
String name;
String gender;
String species;
Integer weight;
// behavior [methods]
// visitor behavior
void roamAroundAndLook();
void takePictures();
Ticket buyTicket();
void eat();
void poop();
// staff behavior
void cleanPremises();
void eat();
void poop();
void routineCheckupOnAnimals();
// animal behavior
}
void testZooEntityRoamAroundAndLook() {
ZooEntity entity = new ZooEntity();
entity.roamAroundAndLook();
assertEquals(...)
}
```





üêû Problems with the above code?
‚ùì Readable
It looks pretty readable. But there are some issues.
Imagine if we had more charcters
- different types of employees
- managers
- special (VVIP) guests
- transfer animals
- trainers for the animals
Right now it is readable, but as the complexity grows, it will quickly become unreadable
‚ùì Testable
Testing is difficult because making changes to staff behavior can cause unexpected changes in visitor
behavior - because all the code is tied to each other - using the same class state
Tightly coupled
‚ùì Extensible
we'll come back to this later
‚ùì Maintainable
imagine that there are 10 devs working on different animals / staff / visitors - all of them are modifying
the same file
when they commit the code and submit it, they will get merge conflicts!




üõ† How to fix this?


==================================
‚≠ê Single Responsibility Principle
==================================
- Every class/function/module (unit-of-code) should have 1 and only 1 "well-defined" responsibility.
- Any piece of code should have only 1 reason to change
- if you identify a piece of code which violates this - you should split that code into multiple pieces
```java
class ZooEntity {
// common attributes
String name;
Integer age;
String gender;
void eat();
void poop();
}
// individual responsibilities will go into separate pieces of code
class Visitor extends ZooEntity {
String address;
void roamAroundAndLook();
void takePictures();
Ticket buyTicket();
}
class ZooStaff extends ZooEntity {
Integer employeeID;
Integer monthlySalary;
String address;
void cleanPremises();
void routineCheckupOnAnimals();

}
class Animal extends ZooEntity {
String species;
Integer weight;
}


```

- Readable
Aren't there wayy too many classes & files now? Yes!
In reality whenever you want to make a code change, you are working with 1 specific feature/request - you
only need to look at a handful of files
Yes, we've more files, but each file is very very easy to read
- Testable
Now the code is decoupled - making changes in one class doesn't effect the other classes!
It becomes easier to test correctly and exhaustively!
- Maintainable
Now if a dev is working on visitor, another dev is working on animal - will they have merge conflicts?
No!
the dev working on visitor doesn't need to know anything about animals
