                                                       **SOLID PRINCIPLES**

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that, when followed, help create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming.


‚úÖ Goals
========
We'd like to make our code
1. readability
2. maintainbility
3. testability
4. extensibility

===================
üíé SOLID Principles
===================
- Single Responsibilty Principle
- Open/Closed
- Liskov's Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion
Inversion of Dependency / Inversion of Control / Interface Segregation
Dependency Inversion / Dependency Injection



üí≠ Context
==========
- Simple Zoo Game ü¶ä
- Some characters - zoo staff, visitors, animals, ...
- Some structures - cages, walls, doors, ...




üé® Design Characters
====================
```java
class ZooEntity {
// classes are blueprints for concepts

// attributes [properties]
// visitor attributes
String visitorName;
Integer age;
String gender;
String address;
// zoo staff attributes
String staffName;
Integer employeeID;
Integer monthlySalary;
String address;
String gender;
// animal attributes
String name;
String gender;
String species;
Integer weight;
// behavior [methods]
// visitor behavior
void roamAroundAndLook();
void takePictures();
Ticket buyTicket();
void eat();
void poop();
// staff behavior
void cleanPremises();
void eat();
void poop();
void routineCheckupOnAnimals();
// animal behavior
}
void testZooEntityRoamAroundAndLook() {
ZooEntity entity = new ZooEntity();
entity.roamAroundAndLook();
assertEquals(...)
}
```





üêû Problems with the above code?
‚ùì Readable
It looks pretty readable. But there are some issues.
Imagine if we had more charcters
- different types of employees
- managers
- special (VVIP) guests
- transfer animals
- trainers for the animals
Right now it is readable, but as the complexity grows, it will quickly become unreadable
‚ùì Testable
Testing is difficult because making changes to staff behavior can cause unexpected changes in visitor
behavior - because all the code is tied to each other - using the same class state
Tightly coupled
‚ùì Extensible
we'll come back to this later
‚ùì Maintainable
imagine that there are 10 devs working on different animals / staff / visitors - all of them are modifying
the same file
when they commit the code and submit it, they will get merge conflicts!




üõ† How to fix this?


==================================
‚≠ê Single Responsibility Principle
==================================
- Every class/function/module (unit-of-code) should have 1 and only 1 "well-defined" responsibility.
- Any piece of code should have only 1 reason to change
- if you identify a piece of code which violates this - you should split that code into multiple pieces
```java
class ZooEntity {
// common attributes
String name;
Integer age;
String gender;
void eat();
void poop();
}
// individual responsibilities will go into separate pieces of code
class Visitor extends ZooEntity {
String address;
void roamAroundAndLook();
void takePictures();
Ticket buyTicket();
}
class ZooStaff extends ZooEntity {
Integer employeeID;
Integer monthlySalary;
String address;
void cleanPremises();
void routineCheckupOnAnimals();

}
class Animal extends ZooEntity {
String species;
Integer weight;
}


```

- Readable
Aren't there wayy too many classes & files now? Yes!
In reality whenever you want to make a code change, you are working with 1 specific feature/request - you
only need to look at a handful of files
Yes, we've more files, but each file is very very easy to read
- Testable
Now the code is decoupled - making changes in one class doesn't effect the other classes!
It becomes easier to test correctly and exhaustively!
- Maintainable
Now if a dev is working on visitor, another dev is working on animal - will they have merge conflicts?
No!
the dev working on visitor doesn't need to know anything about animals


üê¶ Design a Bird
================
```java
class Bird extends Animal {
String species;
Integer beakLength;
Integer wingSpan;
void fly() {
if (species == "sparrow")
print("flap wings and fly low")
else if (species == "eagle")
print("glide elegantly very high in the sky")
else if (species == "peacock")
print("only pehens can fly, make peacocks cant")
}
}
```

üïä Different birds fly differently
Do you always write code yourself? Or do you often import external libraries?


```java
// go to github, search for zoo libraries
[SimpleZooLibrary]
{
class ZooEntity { ... }
class Animal extends ZooEntity { ... }
class Bird extends Animal {
String species;
Integer beakLength;
Integer wingSpan;
void fly() {
if (species == "sparrow")
print("flap wings and fly low")
else if (species == "eagle")
print("glide elegantly very high in the sky")
else if (species == "peacock")
print("only pehens can fly, make peacocks cant")
else if (species == "helibird")
print(...)
}
}
}
// simple-library.dll .so .com .jar .pyc ...
// minified js .exe
// you might not have the source code always
// even if you do have it


[MyZooGame]
{
import SimpleZooLibrary.Bird;
// add a new type of Bird which flies in a different manner
// scientists discovered HeliBird
class ZooGame {
void main() {
Bird sparrow = new Bird(species="sparrow");
sparrow.fly();
Bird eagle = new Bird(species="eagle");

eagle.fly();
}
}
}
```

üêû Problems with the above code?
- Readable
- Testable
- Maintainable
- Extensible - FOCUS!
A lot of times, we might not have modificiation access to some code. In this case, we might not be able to
extend it.
Zerodha - Kite API
Google Adsense - Developer API
Google Adsense team - exposed an API for the Google Search team
Twitter - Developer API

üõ† How to fix this?


=======================
‚≠ê Open/Close Principle
=======================
- Your code should be closed for modification, yet, open for extension!
- We wish the code that we've written to be "owned" by us - others should NOT be able to make
modifications
- At the same time, we wish others to be able to add new functionality - they should be able to extend it.
‚ùî Why is it wrong to modify existing code?
typical flow in large companies - over 1 month!
- dev writes code on their local machine, test it, commit it - make a Pull Request (PR)
- this PR goes for review - rest of the team with review the PR, and they will suggest improvements
- after a bunch or iteratiions - your PR gets merged
- deployment process
+ QA team - they will write more tests (unit, integration)
+ Staging servers - tested there
+ Production servers
* A/B testing
- deploye to only 5% of the userbase
- monitor
- are more exceptions being raised
- are the users complaining
- are ther emore support tickets
- are the reviews going down
- is the revenue being effected
* finally the code is deployed to the entire userbase

* ```java
[SimpleZooLibrary]
{
class ZooEntity { ... }
class Animal extends ZooEntity { ... }
abstract class Bird extends Animal {
String species;
Integer beakLength;
Integer wingSpan;
abstract void fly()
}
class Sparrow extends Bird {

void fly() {
print("flap wings and fly low")
}
}
class Eagle extends Bird {
void fly() {
print("glide elegantly very high in the sky")
}
}
}

[MyZooGame]
{
import SimpleZooLibrary.Bird;
// add a new type of Bird which flies in a different manner
// scientists discovered HeliBird
class ZooGame {
void main() {
Bird sparrow = new Bird(species="sparrow");
sparrow.fly();
Bird eagle = new Bird(species="eagle");
eagle.fly();
}
}
}
```

- Extension
```java
import SimpleZooLibrary.Bird;
// add a new type of Bird which flies in a different manner
// scientists discovered HeliBird
class HellBird extends Bird {
void fly() {
print("fly like a helicopter!")
}
}
class ZooGame {
void main() {
Sparrow sparrow = new Sparrow();
sparrow.fly();
Eagle eagle = new Eagle();
eagle.fly();
HellBird helli = new HellBird();
helli.fly()
}
}
```

You should plan for these future "extensions" preemptively!
As the library author, it is your responsibility to write code that follows Open/Close from day 1
THIS is why companies pay so much to devs
Max salary that devs can get in India - Bangalore/Hyd/Chennai
dev salaries in India - goes upto 3 Cr (base) - Principal Engineer / Staff Engineer (10+ years of experience
in tier 1 companies)
Because these people are able to anticipate requirement changes, and they're able to write code that doesn't
need to change in the face of changing requirements!
‚ùî Isn't this the same thing that we did for Single Responsibility as well? Al we did was apply OOP
techniques and split a large class into multiple classes by using inheritance!
‚ùî Does that mean that OCP == SRP?
No. The resolution was the same, but the intent was different

SRP = readability, maintainability, testability
OCP = extensibility
üîó All the SOLID principles are linked together - if you stick to one, you might get others for free!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of you don't understand the OOP concepts properly

üêì Can all the birds fly?
=========================

```java
abstract class Bird {
abstract void fly();
void eat() { ... }
void poop() { ... }
void speak() { ... }
}
class Sparrow extends Bird {
void fly() {
print("fly low")
}
}
class Eagle extends Bird {
void fly() {
print("fly high")
}
}
class Kiwi extends Bird {
void fly() {
}
}
```
Are there some species of birds which can't fly?
Penguins, Kiwi, Ostrich, Emu, Dodo ...
>
> ‚ùì How do we solve this?
>
> ‚Ä¢ Throw exception with a proper message
> ‚Ä¢ Don't implement the `fly()` method
> ‚Ä¢ Return `null`
> ‚Ä¢ Redesign the system
>
Run away from the problem - Simply don't implement the fly() method
